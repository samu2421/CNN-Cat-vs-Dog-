# CNN-Cat-vs-Dog-
A CNN model for the task of classifying images of cats and dogs.

We describe the dataset we used for the project, which consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs, and explain the pre-processing steps we took to prepare the data for training. We then describe the CNN model architecture we used for the project, which consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification. We explain the training process for the model, including the hyperparameters we used and the metrics we used to evaluate its performance. We present the results of the project, including the accuracy of the model on the test set, and compare the performance of our model to other state-of-the-art models in the literature. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future directions of the project, and suggest some implications for the field of deep learning and image classification. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of CNNs for image classification tasks, and highlights the potential for applying these models to a wide range of real-world problems
